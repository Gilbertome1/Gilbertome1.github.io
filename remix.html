						<p> Fake Love </p>
						<p> DATE  | 2/06/18 </p>
						<br>
						<p> This piece was made for Valentine's day. Its purpose was to display the fake expectations of what love should be, how it should be spent, and what should be purchased.In this design I purposly made it look like a magazine style image to represent the lack of reality in the design.</p>

						<p> During the process I took stock images from Pexels and layered them on top of each other. After that I blended in the balloons and selected around the people to place them in the image. After some filtering and blending I created shadows for the balloons and people by copying them, filling them with black, and then lowering the opacity. Of course followed by some more blending techniques. </p>
